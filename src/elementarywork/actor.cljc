  "ElementaryWorkActor — the ISCO-08 9629 elementary-labour site
  scheduling/logistics coordination actor as a `langgraph.graph/
  state-graph` (ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section). One graph
  run = one site-coordination operation request (intake -> advise ->
  govern -> decide -> commit/hold, with a human-approval interrupt for
  escalated proposals). No infinite internal loop; checkpointed per
  superstep so an interrupted run can resume after human sign-off.
  Modeled closely on cloud-itonami-isco-9212's livestockfarm.actor for
  the closest comparable generic elementary-occupation hazard-domain
  shape, adapted for ISCO-08 9629 'Elementary Workers Not Elsewhere
  Classified' — a residual category covering diverse manual/elementary
  labour work not captured by a more specific ISCO 9xxx code, so
  standard elementary-labour hazards apply generically (manual-
  lifting/strain hazard, varied-site-condition hazard, outdoor/indoor
  exposure) without a single dominant hazard type.

  ```text
  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold               (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the Elementary Worker Advisor can never
  directly commit an operating record the ElementaryWorkGovernor
  refuses, and can never make this actor finalize a labour-work-
  execution decision (e.g. finalizing a specific labour-work operation)
  or a site-safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring a site safety
  cleared), and can never override a site safety supervisor's judgment
  — every commit-record! call is gated behind `:decide`, and both
  scope-excluded decision classes are a permanent hard block regardless
  of disposition path. This actor coordinates SITE SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS
  ONLY — it never performs labour work itself and never makes a
  site-safety-clearance decision itself."
